COLua
=====

COLua (Classes and Objects for Lua) is a Lua 5.2 module that adds supports for Object Oriented Programming. To install it, all you need to do is install `COLua.lua` in your `package.path`. Then you can load it using `local class = require "COLua"`. Examples for using COLua can be found in `examples`. 

One of the goals of COLua is to also work in environments where C code is not available. Therefore, COLua shall be implemented in pure Lua 5.2. 

The official source of documentation for COLua is our [wiki](https://github.com/Wobbo/COLua/wiki). This should alwasy be the most up to date source of information. But if you can't find what you are looking for, you can alwasy send me an email or open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Wobbo/COLua/issues).
